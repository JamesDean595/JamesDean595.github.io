Hello, and welcome to the site! I'm currently a 4th-year PhD candidate at West Virginia University, and where my focus is macroeconomics and monetary policy. Specifically, my research looks at the changes in monetary policy with the introduction of unconventional policies, like forward guidance and quantitative easing. I also enjoy teaching, with most of my teaching experience focused on macroeconomics as well. Before grad school at WVU, I earned my bachelor's degree in economics from Lubbock Christian University, where I also played for the golf team. I'll be on the job market in the 2021-2022 academic year, and I'll be at the (virtual) Westerns, Southerns, and AEA meetings. If you're interested, you can find a copy of my CV [here](pages/CV/).

## Job Market Paper: Averaging Away Uncertainty?
My job market paper considers whether average inflation targeting (AIT) improves monetary policy when the zero-lower bound is frequently binding and there is uncertainty in the output gap. In essence, we frequently struggle to know the economy's "potential" in real-time, so we're often setting policy based on a misperception of the economy's health. What's more, interest rates have fallen in the industrialized world, so interest rate policy is more frequently constrained by the lower bound, forcing the Fed to use unconventional tools like quantitative easing. To examine whether average inflation targeting actually improves policy when we consider these limitations, I augment a model of unconventional policy with AIT and incorporate persistent mispercepceptions in the output gap. I then estimate the model on post-Crisis US data, examine the efficiency frontier of monetary policy, and compare the welfare gains as the averaging window changes. Results are still TBD, so stay tuned.
